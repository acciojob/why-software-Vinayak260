  <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>

  <p>
    I want to become a software developer because I am passionate about technology and problem-solving. 
    Creating software allows me to build solutions that can impact people’s lives positively, automate 
    tasks, and innovate in ways that were not possible before. I also enjoy the continuous learning 
    opportunities in this field, as programming constantly challenges me to improve my skills and adapt 
    to new technologies. Ultimately, becoming a developer is a way to combine my creativity with logic 
    to create meaningful and functional applications.
